What is it?
===========

A little script to quickly add vhosts to your local apache configuration for development purposes.

Given a name like "mysite" and a path to the files for the site, it will make the site appear at http://mysite.local.

Usage
=====

	sudo vhostman add mysite ~/path/to/mysite/webroot

Installation
============

Make a directory to contain all the generated vhost config files:

	sudo mkdir /etc/apache2/extra/vhosts

Add this line to your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf file:

	Include /private/etc/apache2/extra/vhosts/*.conf

Ensure it's executable:

	chmod 0777 /path/to/add-vhost.rb

Link this into your /usr/local/bin like so:

	ln -s /path/to/vhostman.rb /usr/local/bin/vhostman
